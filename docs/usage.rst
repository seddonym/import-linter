Configuration file location
---------------------------

Before running the linter, you need to supply configuration in a file.
If not specified over the command line, Import Linter will look in the current directory for one of the following files:

- ``setup.cfg`` (INI format)
- ``.importlinter`` (INI format)
- ``pyproject.toml`` (TOML format)


Top level configuration
-----------------------

Your file must contain an ``importlinter`` section providing top-level (i.e. non-contract based) configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [importlinter]
    root_package = mypackage
    # Optional:
    include_external_packages = True

Or, with multiple root packages:

.. code-block:: ini

    [importlinter]
    root_packages=
        packageone
        packagetwo
    # Optional:
    include_external_packages = True

**Options:**

- ``root_package``:
  The name of the top-level Python package to validate. This package must be importable: usually this
  means it is has been installed using pip, or it's in the current directory. (Either this or ``root_packages`` is required.)
- ``root_packages``:
  The names of the top-level Python packages to validate. This should be used in place of ``root_package`` if you want
  to analyse the imports of multiple packages. (Either this or ``root_package`` is required.)
- ``include_external_packages``:
  Whether to include external packages when building the import graph. Unlike root packages, external packages are
  *not* statically analyzed, so no imports from external packages will be checked. However, imports *of* external
  packages will be available for checking. Not every contract type uses this.
  For more information, see `the Grimp build_graph documentation`_. (Optional.)

.. _the Grimp build_graph documentation: https://grimp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#grimp.build_graph

**Interpolations**

When using `.ini` file, extended interpolation may be used, which may be helpful when
groups of modules need to be referenced in multiple places.

.. code-block:: ini

    [importlinter:contract:1]
    name = Ports should not depend on adapters.
    type = forbidden
    source_modules = ${ports:all}
    forbidden_modules = ${adapters:all}

    [ports]
    all =
        mypackage.inbound
        yourpackage.outbound

    [adapters]
    all =
        mypackage.adapters
        yourpackage.adapters

Contracts
---------

Additionally, you will want to include one or more contract configurations. These take the following form:

.. code-block:: ini

    [importlinter:contract:1]
    name = Contract One
    type = some_contract_type
    (additional options)

    [importlinter:contract:2]
    name = Contract Two
    type = another_contract_type
    (additional options)

Notice each contract has its own INI section, which begins ``importlinter:contract:`` and ends in an
arbitrary, unique code (in this example, the codes are ``1`` and ``2``). These codes are purely
to adhere to the INI format, which does not allow duplicate section names.

Every contract will always have the following key/value pairs:

    - ``name``: A human-readable name for the contract.
    - ``type``: The type of contract to use (see :doc:`contract_types`.)

Each contract type defines additional options that you supply here.

Running the linter
------------------

Import Linter provides a single command: ``lint-imports``.

Running this will check that your project adheres to the contracts you've defined.

**Arguments:**

- ``--config``:
  (optional) The configuration file to use. This overrides the default file search strategy.
  By default it's assumed that the file is an ini-file unless the file extension is ``toml``.
- ``show_timings``:
  Display the times taken to build the graph and check each contract.

**Default usage:**

.. code-block:: text

    lint-imports

**Using a different filename or location:**

.. code-block:: text

    lint-imports --config path/to/alternative-config.ini

**Showing timings:**

.. code-block:: text

    lint-imports --show-timings
