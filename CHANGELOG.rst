* Upgrade Grimp to 1.2.3.
* Officially support Python 3.9.

1.2 (2020-09-23)
----------------

* Upgrade Grimp to 1.2.2.
* Add SetField.
* Use a SetField for ignore_imports options.
* Add support for non `\w` characters in import exceptions.

1.1 (2020-06-29)
----------------

* Bring 1.1 out of beta.

1.1b2 (2019-11-27)
------------------

* Update to Grimp v1.2, significantly increasing speed of building the graph.

1.1b1 (2019-11-24)
------------------

* Provide debug mode.
* Allow contracts to mutate the graph without affecting other contracts.
* Update to Grimp v1.1.
* Change the rendering of broken layers contracts by combining any shared chain beginning or endings.
* Speed up and make more comprehensive the algorithm for finding illegal chains in layer contracts. Prior to this,
  layers contracts used Grimp's find_shortest_chains method for each pairing of layers. This found the shortest chain
  between each pair of modules across the two layers. The algorithm was very slow and not comprehensive. With this
  release, for each pair of layers, a copy of the graph is made. All other layers are removed from the graph, any
  direct imports between the two layers are stored. Next, the two layers in question are 'squashed', the shortest
  chain is repeatedly popped from the graph until no more chains remain. This results in more comprehensive results,
  and at significantly increased speed.

1.0 (2019-17-10)
----------------

* Officially support Python 3.8.

1.0b5 (2019-10-05)
