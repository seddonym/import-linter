Changelog
=========

latest
------

* Update to Grimp 2.4.

1.8.0 (2023-03-03)
------------------

* Add caching.

1.7.0 (2023-01-27)
------------------

* Switch from optional dependency of ``toml`` to required dependency of ``tomli`` for Python versions < 3.11.
* Use DetailedImport type hinting made available in Grimp 2.2.
* Allow limiting by contract.

1.6.0 (2022-12-7)
-----------------

* Add exhaustiveness option to layers contracts.

1.5.0 (2022-12-2)
-----------------

* Officially support Python 3.11.

1.4.0 (2022-10-04)
------------------

* Remove upper bounds on dependencies. This allows usage of Grimp 2.0, which should significantly speed up checking of
  layers contracts.
* Add --verbose flag to lint-imports command.
* Improve algorithm for independence contracts, in the following ways:
    - It is significantly faster.
    - As with layers contracts, reports of illegal indirect imports reports now include multiple start
      and end points (if they exist).
    - Illegal indirect imports that are via other modules listed in the contract are no longer listed.

1.2.5 (2021-09-21)
------------------

------------------

* Add allow_indirect_imports to Forbidden Contract type
* Upgrade Grimp to 1.2.3.
* Officially support Python 3.9.

1.2 (2020-09-23)
----------------

* Upgrade Grimp to 1.2.2.
* Add SetField.
* Use a SetField for ignore_imports options.
* Add support for non `\w` characters in import exceptions.

1.1 (2020-06-29)
----------------

* Bring 1.1 out of beta.

1.1b2 (2019-11-27)
------------------

* Update to Grimp v1.2, significantly increasing speed of building the graph.

1.1b1 (2019-11-24)
------------------

* Provide debug mode.
* Allow contracts to mutate the graph without affecting other contracts.
* Update to Grimp v1.1.
* Change the rendering of broken layers contracts by combining any shared chain beginning or endings.
* Speed up and make more comprehensive the algorithm for finding illegal chains in layer contracts. Prior to this,
  layers contracts used Grimp's find_shortest_chains method for each pairing of layers. This found the shortest chain
  between each pair of modules across the two layers. The algorithm was very slow and not comprehensive. With this
  release, for each pair of layers, a copy of the graph is made. All other layers are removed from the graph, any
  direct imports between the two layers are stored. Next, the two layers in question are 'squashed', the shortest
  chain is repeatedly popped from the graph until no more chains remain. This results in more comprehensive results,
  and at significantly increased speed.

1.0 (2019-17-10)
----------------

* Officially support Python 3.8.

1.0b5 (2019-10-05)

------------------

* Add https://pre-commit.com configuration.
* Use find_shortest_chains instead of find_shortest_chain on the Grimp import graph.
* Add Forbidden Modules contract type.
